# How to setup project
## Option 1: Without docker
#### Step 1: Clone the repo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pivorakmeetup/pivorak-web-app.git
```
#### Step 2: Install dependencies
- Install ruby 2.6.9
```sh
$ cd pivorak-web-app
$ rvm install ruby-2.6.9
```
- Install gems
```sh
$ rvm use ruby-2.6.9@pivorak --create
$ bundle
```
- Setup database
    **Notice:** Before database setup you should install *Redis*. Look install instructions here:
    - for Ubuntu: https://goo.gl/PbG00W
    - for MacOS: https://goo.gl/W8xQMJ

    **Notice:**  You should have PostgreSQL >= 9.4
    To check your version
```sh
$ psql --version
```

```sh
$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
$ rails db:setup
$ rails s
```

**Notice:**  If during the execution `rails db:setup` you get an error messages:
```sh
'require': cannot load such file -- bundler (LoadError)
```
run `gem pristine --all` and repeat `rails db:setup`.


## Option 2: With docker
#### Step 1: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
#### Step 2: Clone the repo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pivorakmeetup/pivorak-web-app.git
```
#### Step 3: Clone database config
```sh
$ cd pivorak-web-app
$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
```
#### Step 4: Build project
```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run runner bundle install
```

**Notice:** How to deal with docker?

**Test environment:**
To run tests, first setup test database
```sh
$ docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test runner bundle exec rails db:setup
```
and then run test suite

```sh
$ docker-compose run runner bundle exec rspec
```

**Development environment:**
To run the app in development, first prepare development database
```sh
$ docker-compose run runner bundle exec rails db:setup
```
and then execute
```sh
$ docker-compose up rails
```

# What should I know before I get started?
## Git Branches

The main and the most up-to-date branch of the project is `development` branch.
Please checkout your new branch from `development` branch.
And use `development` branch for deployment to production.

## Design Decisions
- We use Ruby on Rails as a framework but with some additional application design layers.
### Layers:
- Model
- View
- Controller
- Service
- Finder
- Policy

#### Model
Model should containe only data-logic.
- Processing -> to service/interactor.
- Complex queries -> to finders
- Predicates -> to policy.

#### View
View should be clean as much as possible. Please, use helpers to avoid call methods with some params at template.

#### Controller
Skinny controller. Only REST. Only 7 allowed actions (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy). If you need additional action - extract to new sub-controller


#### Service
Single responsibility resource action that represents business logic.
Only one public method allowed `.call`. Everething else - to private

#### Finder
QueryObject.


#### Policy
Domain predicates store. Knows answers for all questions.
